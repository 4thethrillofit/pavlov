======
Pavlov is a project out of the HumanAPI hackathon. It uses the user's health data to encourage positive healthy behavior through friendly competition. 

Users can set up "challenges" with their friends with a target goal and a wager amount. The participants who do not complete the challenge will not get their money back and the participant who do will get to split the pot.

The supported challenge types right now are: 
- Number of steps
- Minutes of easy exercise, 
- Minutes of moderate exercise
- Minutes of rigorous exercise

We intend to integrate payment through Stripe (a TODO).
